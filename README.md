# DemoExceptionInCMark
A minimal iOS Application in Swift to Demonstrate an Abort in CMark

I created this quickie project because my application OpenLibrary Browser crashed while attempting to display the biography for Flannery O'Connor. I traced the problem to the point where CMark calls the abort() function.
